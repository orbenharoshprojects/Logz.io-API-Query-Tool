> Additional options are described in the `data_processor.py` file. Remember, the default timezone in your Logz.io OpenSearch is set to your browser's timezone. If needed, contact the Logz.io Support team for modifications.

## üêû Debugging & Troubleshooting

- **Data Mismatches**: If the fetched data looks off, inspect the raw API responses. The `data_processor.py` script interprets the data in specific ways and can be modified.

- **UI Issues**: If the interface doesn't render correctly, ensure that all static assets are being served properly. The confidured pattrens can be modified in the `form.html` and the `data_processor.py` files. 

- **Connectivity Issues**: If you can't fetch data, ensure that the Docker container can reach Logz.io. Check network permissions and configurations.
